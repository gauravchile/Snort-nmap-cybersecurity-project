# Incident Response Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the incident response plan for network intrusion detection and vulnerability scanning using Snort and Nmap. The plan includes details on project setup, Snort configuration, Nmap scanning, and attack simulation.

## 2. Project Setup

### Network Topology

- **Virtual Machines (VMs):**
  - **IDS VM (Snort):** This VM will host Snort, configured to monitor network traffic.
  - **Target VM(s):** These VMs simulate a network environment that will be scanned and attacked using Nmap.

- **Network Configuration:**
  - Use VirtualBox or VMware to create an internal network where the VMs can communicate with each other.
  - Assign static IP addresses to the VMs for consistency.

### Installing Snort

**On the IDS VM:**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install snort

Verify Snort Installation:
snort -V

#Installing Nmap On the Attacker VM:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nmap

Verify Nmap Installation:
nmap -V

#Snort Configuration
#Edit Snort Configuration File:
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf

#Set Network Variables:
Define the network you are protecting:
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.64.0/24

Custom Rule Creation
Example Custom Rule:

Create a rule to detect ICMP traffic (ping requests):
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP Ping detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
Save this rule in a custom rule file, such as local.rules.

Include Custom Rules in Configuration:

Add the following line to the snort.conf file:
include /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

#Running Snort in IDS Mode

Start Snort:
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

Monitor Alerts:
Snort will display alerts in the console when it detects suspicious activity.

#Nmap Scanning
#Basic Nmap Scans
#TCP SYN Scan:
nmap -sS 192.168.56.102

#Service Version Detection:
nmap -sV 192.168.56.102

#OS Detection:
nmap -O 192.168.56.102

#Vulnerability Scan Using NSE:
nmap --script vuln 192.168.56.102

#Brute Force Script Example:
nmap --script ssh-brute -p 22 192.168.56.102

#Attack Simulation
Simulate Attacks
DDoS Attack Simulation:

Use a tool like hping3 to generate a large number of requests:

sudo hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 192.168.56.102

#Analyze Snort Alerts
Check Snort Alerts:
Review the Snort console or log files for alerts generated during the attack simulation. Analyze the logs to determine if the attack was detected correctly.
